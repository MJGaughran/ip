- RS-232 connection:
Needs jumper tying pin 6 (DSR on instrument) to Space (+12V).  This

. . . .
. . . .
. . . ._
. . . ._|- jumpered these two together (see XM-Octal manual)

The cable should be connected straight through except for a 2/3 swap
and a 7/8 swap.  Pin 4 could (should?) be disconnected.  In my testing
it didn't seem to matter although the manual says to disconnect it.
